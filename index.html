<h1>The Life of Emmanuel Visoso</h1>
<p>As you read in the title my name is Emmanuel Visoso im 15 about to turn 16 in a couple days and going onto being a junior. As time passes by and days become shorter i soon relize that im going to be going to college any time soon and i still dont kow what i want to do for a living. However im not too worried about it because i have accuired many skills from summer programs so far i have taken two step programs.one about engineering of bridges and the one im currently taking, coding. i would say im prepaired for the new world but whos actually prepaired though. but enough of my future and more about my present, im very strong mentally, i dont give up when i run into a problem or struggle. instead i try to find solutions to my problems, that could either be by asking another person for help, searching online, or just try t figure it 0out by myself.</p>
<ol><li>a goal of mine is to be the first one in my family to go to college</li></ol><ol><li>live a enjoyable life</li></ol>
